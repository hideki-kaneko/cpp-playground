# Cpp-Playground
Cpp-Playground is a container with a compiler and debugger for modern C++ projects.

## Requirements
- Docker
- VS Code with [DevContainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (Recommended)

## Installation
Clone this repo and open the root folder with VSCode.

Use the 'Dev Containers: Reopen in Container' command from the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P).

Done! Now you can add a new file, build and debug with F5.

## Notes
The 'project' folder will be mounted to your host OS, so any files within the folder will persist.
